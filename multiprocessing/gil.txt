GIL: Global interpreter lock 

- Allows only one thread at a time to execute 
- Needed in CPython since the memory management is not safe 

- Avoid: 
    - use multiprocessing 
    - use a different free threaded python implementation 
    - use python as a wrapper for third party (C/C++) libraries ex. numpy, scipy
