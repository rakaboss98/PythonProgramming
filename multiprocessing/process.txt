A process is an instance of a program, ex. running a browser or running a python 
interpreter 

A process can have multiple threads

+ Takes advantage of multiple cpus
+ Seperate memory space, memory is not shared between processes
+ Processes are interruptable/killable 
+ One GIL for each process
+ Great for cpu bound processing 
+ One process can be started independent of the other 

- Starting a process is slower than starting a thread 
- Heavyweight 
- More memory 
- IPC (Inter process communication is more complicated)
