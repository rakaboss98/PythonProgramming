Thread is an entity within a process that can be scheduled 

+ Lightweight 
+ All threads within a process share the same memory 
+ Starting a thread is faster than starting a process 
+ Great for I/O Bound tasks 

- Threading is limited by global interpreter lock 
- No effect on cpu bound tasks 
- Non interruptable/killable
- Careful with race conditions
